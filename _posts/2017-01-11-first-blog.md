# My First Post

Hello!

This is my first post.  I am excited to share my journey with everyone here.  To be honest, I am also using this to keep track of my skills etc.  I will be doing a lot of work and getting everything in order for my journey to San Fran! Yieeeew!


### Things I find make this useful:

 * [Google Anayltics Training](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/) for learning GA
 * [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-thinking-innovation/lecture/F04r6/learning-launch-tool) for design thinking
 * [Ted Talks](http://www.liveperson.com/connected-customer/posts/cx-brain-these-are-5-ted-talks-you-need-see) for 5 useful TED Talks in CX
