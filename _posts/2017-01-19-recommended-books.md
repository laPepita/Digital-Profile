## Books That I Recommend for UX

Steve Krug’s - Don’t Make Me Think

and

Susan M. Weinschenk's - 100 Things every designer needs to know about people
![Book cover](http://www.peachpit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=0321767535)

Both are rated pretty highly and have been recommend by a number of people at both Deloitte Digital and other areas.
