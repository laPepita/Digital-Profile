## Books That I Recommend for UX

The following books have been recommended based on quallity, to me by a number of people.  They have both been rated higher than 4/5 on [Good reads](http://www.goodreads.com/) and have over 1,000 reader ratings.  I will keep this list up to date as time goes by. 

### Steve Krug’s - Don’t Make Me Think
> ###### [Good reads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited)
>   “Since Don’t Make Me Think was first published in 2000, over 400,000 Web designers and developers have relied on Steve Krug’s guide to help them understand the principles of intuitive navigation and information design.”

and

### Susan M. Weinschenk's - 100 Things every designer needs to know about people

> ###### [Good reads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10778139-100-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people)
>   “We design to elicit responses from people. We want them to buy something, read more, or take action of some kind. Designing without understanding what makes people act the way they do is like exploring a new city without a map: results will be haphazard, confusing, and inefficient. This book combines real science and research with practical examples to deliver a guide every designer needs. With it you ll be able to design more intuitive and engaging work for print, websites, applications, and products that matches the way people think, work, and play.
Learn to increase the effectiveness, conversion rates, and usability of your own design projects by finding the answers to questions such as: 
>    
>  * What grabs and holds attention on a page or screen?
> * What makes memories stick?
> * What is more important, peripheral or central vision?
> * How can you predict the types of errors that people will make?
> * What is the limit to someone s social circle?
> * How do you motivate people to continue on to (the next step?
> * What line length for text is best?
> * Are some fonts better than others? 
>    
>   These are just a few of the questions that the book answers in its deep-dive exploration of what makes people tick."

Both are rated pretty highly and have been recommended by a number of people at both Deloitte Digital and other areas.

Here is a Slideshare [Presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/susanweinschenk/top-10-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people/17-Fact_or_Fiction_People_can) if you want to get a quick summary.  It is a quick browse and well worth your time...

Also [This](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/10-usability-lessons-from-steve-krugs-dont-make-me-think/) is a great quick summary for UX principles by Steve Krug.
