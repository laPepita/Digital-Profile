    detail: I joined the Melbourne office of Deloitte Digital as a grad early 2016. Deloitte Digital was founded in Melbourne which means it has a very advanced and experienced team.  The culture was amazing and working as a consultant I was able to work across such projects as a Front-end Developer, a Service Designer, a User Experience designer and a data analyst.  I also was able to build upon my Adobe Creative Suite skills.

My science major was geology where I ranked top of my class of 100+ in economic geology and rated in the top 5% for all other final year subjects.  My computer science major was HCI (Human-Computer interaction) and general with a minor in mathematics.   For my final year computer science project I developed a machine learning algorithm that recognised written numbers from 1-9 more accurately than a human could with accuracy up to 98.5%.
